**Objective**

The objective of the game is to move around the board and avoid getting hit by the incoming ball before the time runs out.

**MVP**

*  Render a game board with HTML Canvas.
*  To be able to start and reset the game.
*  Create a ball and a block(player) to move around the board.
*  Create win-logic that determines a winner or game-over.

**Reach Goals**

1.  Be able to adjust the timer to increase or decrease time and to count up or down.
2.  Have different levels of skill with the ball moving faster and multiple balls moving on the gameboard.

**Approach To Building The Game**

Started by creating separate HTML, CSS & JS files.
Used HTML5 Canvas to render the board and the game pieces. Used Javascript and jQuery to create functions to trigger events and CSS to style the game. Used Git and Git Hub to save the project each time an update and/or change was made.
