**_Objective_**

The objective of the game is to move around the board and avoid getting hit by the incoming ball for before the time runs out.  

* Move block to avoid getting hit by incoming ball.
* Win by outlasting the timer.
* Lose by getting hit before time ends.

**_Approach To Building Game_**

Started by creating separate HTML, CSS & JS files.
Used HTML5 Canvas to render the board and the game pieces. I used Javascript and jQuery to create functions to trigger events and CSS to style the game.
